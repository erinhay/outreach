## International Women's Day (IWD) at the Institute of Astronomy
In the IWD folder, you will find a jupyter notebook with a tutorial on detecting exoplanet transits using a combination of simulated and real Kepler data. The notebook particularly highlights contributions of women to the Kepler mission and exoplanet discovery. The notebook was first developed for students in Year 9 (age 13-14). The exercises are friendly to students who have no prior coding experience.

This notebook was formatted for use in Google Colab. It can be accessed via the following link:

Thanks to Erik Rosenberg and Steve Young for their help in preparing the IWD educational material!
