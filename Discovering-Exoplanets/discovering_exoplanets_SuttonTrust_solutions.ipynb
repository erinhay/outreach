    "# Discovering Exoplanets Around Distant Stars\n",

    "Humans have known about some of the planets in our own solar system for millenia, with the most recent discoveries of Uranus and Neptune coming in 1781 and 1846 respectively. The next big leap came over a hundred years later in 1995 when the first exoplanet, a planet around another star, was detected.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since then over 5,000 exoplanets have been confirmed. While some of these planets look like planets in our solar system, many of them are very different. Exoplanets can be as large as 22x the radius of the Earth or as hot as 15x the temperature of the Earth. It is the job of astronomers to use data such as the size of the planet and its distance from its host star to figure out how planets form and evolve over time to produce such a wide variety of solar systems. We've come a long way but there is still much more to discover!\n",

    "## Detecting Exoplanet Transits\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that we know what to look for, we can look at **real** data from the Kepler telescope!\n",
    "\n",
    "Kepler was a NASA space telescope designed to detect exoplanets orbiting other stars using the transit method described above. Before Kepler, scientists didn't know if Earth-like rocky planets were common or rare in the galaxy, or if most stars hosted planets at all. The overall aim of the mission was therefore to discover hundreds of new rocky planets, and more generally better understand the prevalence of different types of planets in our galaxy.\n",
    "Specific mission goals included determining the percentage of terrestrial planets in the habital zone of different types of stars, characterizing their sizes, shapes, and orbits, and understanding the properties of stars hosting planetary systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "Kepler launched in 2009. The primary mission consisted of continuous observation of a single field of about 160,000 stars. This allowed for well-measured, low-noise lightcurves so that small rocky planets could be detected despite the small dips they create. \n",
    "After four years of observation, two of Kepler's reaction wheels (that accurately pointed the spacecraft) failed by 2013. NASA scientists designed a new mission dubbed K2 to continue to do science despite these limitations. K2 continued until Kepler's retirement in 2018, observing additional planets as well as discovering 61 supernovae (stellar explosions).\n",
    "\n",
    "Over its lifetime, Kepler observed over 500,000 stars and discovered nearly 3,000 confirmed exoplanets -- many more than the approximately 300 that were known before Kepler. This confirmed that planets are in fact common, with more planets than stars in our galaxy, and Earth-size worlds in particular are likely to orbit up to half the stars we see. After its retirement, Kepler has been succeeded by another NASA mission called TESS. Launched in 2018, TESS also uses transits to search for planets; it takes a complementary approach to *Kepler*, hunting for nearby exoplanets around brighter stars across the whole sky, and is currently in its extended mission.\n",
